# ContentHub

ContentHub is the core central API for a new kind of content management system.

An evolution in the development in web application over the past several years has changed the way that many websites are constructed and has created a new generation of powerful, web based applications. New frameworks enable the creation of powerful separation of views and controllers from the underlying data models. This separation makes the structure of business objects clear, visible and maintainable, but only within the relm of developers with source code access.

At the same time, the state of innovation in the web content management space has largely stalled. Content management today looks largely as it did before the rise of web application frameworks. Rich and mature CMS systems provide powerful features and refined user interfaces. However, most of these systems want to own the full stack -- content modeling, content administration, caching, templating, and website. The nature of these systems tend to cause poor integration with modern web applications.

A modern content management system needs to be built around integration with modern web applicaiton frameworks. And modern web applications, need the power of rich content management tools.

ContentHub is an attempt to build a foundation upon which a smarter approach to modern content management can be built.

The key features of a modern content managment system are built on the best lessons of modern web application development and enterprise content management. These include:

- Distributed system - API and multiple clients are each independent components
- Horizontal scaling at each layer of the system
- Business access to content modeling - This is the perview of analysts and product owners, not developers
- Content modeling built on modern OO principles
- Support for inheritence or mix-ins
- Custom object methods and testing
- Custom event handlers and callbacks
- Rich relationship modeling
- Smart caching at the data layer
- Everything is an object and every object class can be extended
- A robust library of standard classes
- The ability to embed objects within other objects
- Content versioning
- Content staging
- Content variations and multi-variant testing support
- Navigation/taxonomy management
- A ready to use, user friendly admin out of the box
- Highly performant and feature rich search capabilities
- Integration libraries for common web application frameworks
